# AutoML Project: Building an Adaptive Learning System Using TPOT

The primary objective of this project is to develop an automated machine learning (AutoML) system capable of selecting and fine-tuning the best machine learning models and hyperparameters for a given dataset. The chosen framework, TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool), is a genetic algorithm-based optimization tool for automating the pipeline design process, focusing on model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
